## Project Name
Data Science Minor October
## Project Description:
Red Wine Quality Prediction: The dataset consists of different variable like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol-based on which the quality is ranked between 0-10 ( 0 is considered as of poor quality and above 6 is considered to be a good quality one)
## Project Task:
Build a model to predict the quality of the wine based on different input variables like
Fixed acidity content of the wine, residual sugar content, pH values, alcohol content, etc on
which wineâ€™s quality is dependent.
